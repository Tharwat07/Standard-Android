This application is a standard Android app built using Kotlin and Java, with Gradle as the build system. It leverages several modern Android development practices and libraries, including:

- **Retrofit** for network operations, allowing the app to communicate with a backend server.
- **Dagger Hilt** for dependency injection, simplifying the management of dependencies throughout the app.
- **OkHttp** for HTTP client operations, including logging and intercepting requests to add headers.
- **Android Jetpack** components such as ViewBinding for efficient view management.

### Key Features:

1. **User Authentication**: The app includes functionality for user login, sending user credentials to a backend server and handling the response.
2. **Group Information Management**: Users can update group information, including uploading files and managing lists of users.
3. **Network Interception**: Custom interceptors are used to add headers to network requests and handle empty responses.
4. **Dependency Injection**: Dagger Hilt is used to manage dependencies, making the codebase more modular and testable.
5. **Network Connectivity Check**: The app includes utility functions to check network connectivity before making network requests.
6. **Modern UI**: The app uses Material Design components and themes to provide a modern and consistent user interface.

### Project Structure:

- **`network`**: Contains network-related classes, including API interfaces and Retrofit setup.
- **`utilities`**: Utility classes for shared preferences management and other common tasks.
- **`MainActivity`**: The main entry point of the app, set up with ViewBinding.
- **`res`**: Resource files for layouts, colors, strings, and themes.

### Dependencies:

- **Retrofit**: For network requests.
- **OkHttp**: For HTTP client operations.
- **Dagger Hilt**: For dependency injection.
- **Android Jetpack**: For modern Android development practices.

This app serves as a template for building robust and scalable Android applications with a clean architecture and modern development practices.
